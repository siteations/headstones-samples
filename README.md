# headstones-samples
Just some map/animation demos for a historic preservation project

## Notes for Hodaya

What you see in these files represents working with a fixed image underlay (saved from google earth) and creating json plot files from svg (easy to do and free with inkscape). You can then filter or animate those json to see only certain plots.

This would be a really easy route for working with just html/css on your other pages and minimal js to plot the grave-sites.

## Next Steps

I can send a quick video of the google & inkscape workflow, if you want to pursue this fixed image strategy.
